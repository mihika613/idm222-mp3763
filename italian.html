                    Overall review: Eataly is a vibrant culinary destination that brings the essence of Italy to NYC - with meals, shops, and desserts. The tomato basil focaccia was exceptional, with a perfectly baked crust that was crispy on the outside and delightfully soft inside, topped with fresh tomatoes and fragrant basil. The bustling atmosphere adds to the experience, making it a lively spot to enjoy a meal or snack while exploring the various market stalls. While some items can be on the pricier side, the quality of the food is evident. It's a great place to indulge in authentic Italian flavors and enjoy a leisurely meal or shopping experience.

Each dish reflects a commitment to quality and tradition, making Angelo's a true gem in the city's culinary scene.
