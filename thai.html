The spring rolls were crisp and fresh, paired with a dipping sauce that complemented them perfectly. The pineapple fried rice had a great balance of sweet and savory, making every bite enjoyable, and the green curry was rich and creamy with just the right amount of spice. The cozy ambiance adds to the experience, making it a perfect spot for a relaxed, satisfying meal. If you're in the mood for Thai cuisine, this place is a must-visit.

                    Overall review: Chatayee was one of the best Thai restaurants I've been to. The Tom Kha soup was a standout, with its creamy coconut base, perfectly balanced by tangy lime and just the right amount of spice. It was rich but light at the same time, making it super comforting. The mango sticky rice was another highlight‚Äîfresh, sweet mango paired with warm, perfectly cooked sticky rice and a drizzle of coconut milk. It was such a simple yet satisfying way to end the meal. Everything felt authentic and thoughtfully prepared, and the atmosphere was laid-back and welcoming. Definitely a spot I'll be returning to.

                    Overall review: Grandma's Philly is a great spot for a casual, flavorful meal. The tofu satay skewers were the highlight for me‚Äîperfectly grilled with a nice smoky flavor, paired with a rich, creamy peanut sauce that made each bite really satisfying. The menu had a lot of variety, and everything felt fresh, though some dishes didn't stand out as much as the skewers. The casual, homey atmosphere was nice and added to the experience. Overall, it's a solid option for a relaxed meal with some standout flavors, especially if you're into plant-based options.

The pineapple fried rice was incredible‚Äîeach bite had a perfect mix of sweetness and savory goodness that kept me coming back for more. The fluffy rice combined with the juicy pineapple created a dish that felt both comforting and refreshing. Plus, the generous portion left me feeling completely satisfied. The ambiance had a lively vibe, making it a fun place to enjoy a meal with friends. If you're in the mood for some delicious Thai food, this spot should definitely be on your list!
